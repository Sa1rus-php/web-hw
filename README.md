# Home work for web 

First command - gulp. If successful youâ€™ll see Gulp is working!

Second command - gulp css. This will create a /dist/assets folder with a single style.css file that contains the compiled CSS.

Third command - gulp js. JavaScript files will be combined into single file named script.js.

Fourth command - gulp html.  This will compile the content of index.pug into layout.pug and generate a index.html file that we can view in the browser.

Fifth command - gulp watch. Now we only need to run the command once and anytime a file is modified the relevant gulp task will be executed.

Thanks for watching homework!
